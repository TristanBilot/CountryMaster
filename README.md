<h2>Running the game</h2>
<p>First, you'll need to launch the index.php file on a Server such as MAMP for MacOS or WAMP for Windows.</p>
<p>The next step is to access to "/V/map.html" to play the game, this allows you to not login and import a database.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>The aim of the game is to find a country of the map from the flag in a while.</p>
